Behaviour of my Pomodorro Timer:
Default value of timer is 25 and default value for Break timer is 5;
I only allowed the user to enter minutes for work timer and break timer. I Did not implement seconds, so the user can not enter seconds.

Press start and timer starts and goes all the way down to break time and when break time finishes timer goes back to work timer with their default values. For the vibration, it only works on a actual phone not in a emulator.
You can pause and reset.
